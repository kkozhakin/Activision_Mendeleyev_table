# Activision_Mendeleyev_table

This program allows you to build a decay dome for a binary system of compounds based on experimental and theoretical data. Also changes the coefficients of the formulas to maximize approximation to the experiment

# Application features:
• Get information about atoms, chemical compounds and binary systems of compounds;

• Change (add) data on atoms, ions and compounds, as well as add new chemical compounds / systems of compounds;

• Solve the problem of approximating a tabular dependence obtained by experimental estimation of the phase boundary of a binary system, a functional dependence that theoretically determines the thermodynamic mixing function;

• Assess the sensitivity (influence) of the parameters of the mixing function on the final result.
