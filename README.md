# Activision_Mendeleyev_table

This program is intended for visualization of the periodic table:
1.  each atom (ion) will be characterized by crystal-chemical properties (size, formal charge, electric power, etc.);
2.  for the selected set of atoms according to the proposed ratios of the formula coefficients, it is planned to organize a compound formula for which the structural characteristics characterizing it (ionicity, atomic size ratio, coordination numbers for atoms, etc.) will be introduced;
3.  for the selected pair of compounds, it is planned to calculate the region of miscibility from both compounds, the decay dome with physical temperature, and a number of thermodynamic parameters.
