# Activision_Mendeleyev_table

The work shows how, based on an interactive table, D.I. Mendeleev combine into a single settlement reference expandable system a lot of data on the properties of atoms (ions), compounds and a set of formulas. Software systems of formulas for calculating the thermodynamic mixing function ∆Hsm and its approximation are built into the indicated system.

# Application features:
• Get information about atoms, chemical compounds and binary systems of compounds;
• Change (add) data on atoms, ions and compounds, as well as add new chemical compounds / systems of compounds;
• Solve the problem of approximating a tabular dependence obtained by experimental estimation of the phase boundary of a binary system, a functional dependence that theoretically determines the thermodynamic mixing function;
• Assess the sensitivity (influence) of the parameters of the mixing function on the final result.
